# Requirements to run the method

## Packages
This project has been executed on a Windows 10 machine with Python 3.11.5. A few libraries have been used within Python modules. Among these, there are:

- pm4py 2.7.11.11
- scipy 1.11.2
- scikit-learn 1.3.0
- dpkt 1.9.8

Please note that the list above is not comprehensive and there could be other requirements for running the project.

## Data
The data used in this implementation comes from ".pcap" files recording the network traffic data of individual users' video game sessions. For each user, identified by a local IP, several video game sessions are recorded. To work, the ".pcap" files of each user must be collected under a dedicated folder within the "Input/ELE" directory. For example, if a user has IP 192.168.0.2, a directory named "192.168.0.2" with (possibly multiple) ".pcap" files must be in place.

# Execution instructions and project description

The method runs by executing the DOS user_similarity_experimentation.bat script. This script includes experimental parameters to set: 

- The window size to use for feature extraction (fe_window_size)
- The type of normalization applied to the extracted features (normalization_type)
- The type of clustering applied to recognize events (clustering_type)
- The number of clusters to use during clustering (n_clusters)
- The process discovery variant (pd_variant)
- The noise threshold to use during process discovery (noise_threshold)

Once the data has been placed and the variables correctly set, the script executes the two "event_log_extraction.py" and "process_discovery.py" scripts in sequence, resulting in as many event logs and Petri nets as states and users. The results are collected under the "Results" folder.
